<!-- This is a marketplace for beauty salons. I used such technologies, as Symfony framework for back-end, Veu.js framework and bootstrap for front-end, also leaflet Maps to show cities and salons on the map. Description of my project: Admin and salon owner panel description: Administrator has the ability to add, delete and edit new users, grant them administrator or salon owner rights.
